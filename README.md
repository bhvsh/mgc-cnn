# Music Genre Classification using Convolutional Neural Network

The music industry has seen a great influx of new channels to browse and distribute music. This comes with drawbacks, as the data rapidly increases, manual curation becomes a much more difficult task. Audio files have a plethora of features that could be used to make parts of this process a lot easier. It is possible to extract these features, but the best way to handle these for different tasks is not always known. In this thesis, we apply deep learning algorithms to create models, which can classify audio files into various genres. After training the model, we will also analyze the performance of our trained model. The models that will be trained are Basic CNN model, Transfer learning-based model, and Multimodal training.
The best algorithm for the given task will be decided by the highest measure of the metric â€“ accuracy between these three algorithms.

These models are trained using the GTZAN dataset.
